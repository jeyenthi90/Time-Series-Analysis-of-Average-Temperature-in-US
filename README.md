# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Average-Temperature-in-US

Dataset is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

The csv used for this project is GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv

The dataset consists of 4 columns: date, Average temperature,  Average temperature Uncertainity, Country

Data was checked and cleaned for missing values and stationarity

AIRMA model technique was performed to predict the Average Temperature

Python3 was used to implement the whole project
